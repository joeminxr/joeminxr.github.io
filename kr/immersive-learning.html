                As the <b>Lead Engineer</b> at Systems Technology Inc., I designed and delivered XR Training solutions to address a critical challenge within the nuclear industry: <i><b>generational knowledge gap</b></i>. With seasoned technicians retiring at an accelerated rate, capturing and transferring their expertise became paramount.
                <br><br>
                Leveraging Unity, I developed <b>multi-platform training tools</b> deployed across PCVR, Mobile VR, AR headsets, and tablets. These tools provide an interactive, hands-on way to train the next generation of technicians, bridging the knowledge gap and elevating the quality of education.
                <br><br>
                Through XR Training, students could engage with <b>high-risk scenarios in a no-risk environment</b>. From handling complex systems to simulating emergency procedures, the immersive learning experiences ensured they gained critical skills without compromising safety—offering an innovative solution to train confident, capable technicians for the future of the nuclear industry.

                During my time at <b>Accenture</b>, I collaborated with Talespin to explore how <b>Generative AI</b> could transform Immersive Learning experiences. As part of Accenture’s investment in Talespin, I worked closely with their team to integrate <b>AI-driven responses</b> into XR training environments, creating <b>dynamic, adaptive learning scenarios</b> for trainees.
                <br><br>
                This exploratory venture demonstrated how Generative AI could elevate training by enabling participants to tackle complex, real-world challenges in responsive, interactive simulations. However, the success of this approach also highlighted a new roadblock: how to effectively assess or "grade" dynamic, freeform training experiences. While this challenge was outside the MVP's scope, it was identified as the next major step in advancing <b>AI-integrated training solutions</b>.

                Accenture partnered with a government agency to explore innovative training methods for <b>logistics operations</b> within a warehousing facility. As part of this initiative, my team and I prototyped an XR Training solution using AR headsets to enhance both <b>training</b> and <b>real-time assistance</b>.
                <br><br>
                The pilot program allowed trainees to first learn machine operation and processing workflows in a <b>simulated AR environment</b>. Once confident, trainees transitioned to operating the actual machine, with the AR headset providing <b>real-time support</b> through <b>digital annotations</b>, <b>interactive AR artifacts</b>, and <b>step-by-step guidance</b>.
                <br><br>
                This seamless blend of immersive learning and real-world application empowered trainees to build confidence and competence while reducing operational risk and improving efficiency.

            <div class="project-description">
                In partnership with a government agency, Accenture explored innovative training methods to elevate the quality of instruction and education. The agency prioritized <b>AR headsets</b> as the medium for </b>shared, co-located training experiences</b>, emphasizing the need for high visual fidelity without sacrificing performance.
                <br><br>
                To overcome the computational limitations of standalone AR headsets, my team and I integrated <b>Remote Rendering</b>, enabling the offloading of resource-intensive processes like rendering high-quality meshes and textures. This approach allowed the AR devices to focus on <b>experience anchoring</b>, <b>network traffic</b>, and <b>collaborative features</b>. 
                <br><br>
                We rapidly prototyped the initial steps of tactical combat casualty care, incorporating remotely rendered models that trainees could directly interact with. This prototype demonstrated how combining remote rendering with AR technology can deliver visually rich, collaborative learning environments while maintaining seamless interactivity.
